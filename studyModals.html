                            We are enrolling patients with Alzheimer’s Disease for a study investigating the
                            long-term clinical efficacy of a music-based intervention called SoRhythm on slowing the
                            progression of Alzheimer’s Disease symptoms including memory and language impairment.
                            Those who participate will be asked to come in person to the Callier Center Richardson
                            for two sessions which take 2 hours each. In these sessions, those who participate will
                            receive cognitive assessments, a hearing test, and will listen to SoRhythm while
                            receiving a brain recording. After all of the in person sessions are complete, those who
                            participate will be compensated for their time. <!--Please click the link below if you would
