                            <h2>Music-Based Intervention Program for School-Age Children</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted"></p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered"
                                src="img/portfolio/kids-girl-pencil-drawing-159823.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Successful academic activities of school-age children rely on efficient speech and
                                language processing. Although 10-15% of children are diagnosed with some type of
                                speech/language disorder (dyslexia, specific language impairment, etc.), there are
                                likely many children with speech/language deficiencies that are on the borderline of the
                                pathologic range or are within it but lack the diagnostic resources to identify such
                                deficits. Through community partnerships with the Columbus City Schools, we aim to 1)
                                offer brain-based diagnostic opportunities to these children vulnerable to academic
                                failure in the Ohio school system, 2) provide them with music-based intervention
                                programs that will promote brain regions mediating overlapping processes between music
                                and language, and 3) establish neural foundations of brain plasticity following
                                behavioral improvement with a state-of-the-art portable neuroimaging device (i.e.,
                                functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS). This project will constitute the first
                                step towards making a valuable contribution to the Ohio education community, as well as
                                to the neuroscience research field.</p>

                            <p>This study aims to investigate the neural activities that likely undergo substantial changes after Cochlear Implant (CI) surgery in either pre- or post-lingual deaf patients. Patientsâ€™ neural correlates of speech comprehension will be measured using fMRI, in the following timelines: 3, 6, and 12 months after the CI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of CI patients using fMRI.</p>
